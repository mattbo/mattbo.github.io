      <p>Reducing your life to a short text blurb is no job for the faint of
heart.  Given that, there are definitely a few things that might give you an
idea of the type of person you're dealing with.  I've held exactly two jobs
where I couldn't bike to work.  I prefer jeans to slacks and avoid socks
whenever possible.  I can deal with fluorescents when I have to, but I prefer
natural light when possible.  My mother thinks I drink too much coffee, but my
co-workers are shocked by my restraint.  I find that yoga provides exercise along
with meditation, while climbing gets me exercise with a side of problem
solving; I try to find time for both at least once a week.</p>

      <p> From a more professional perspective, I have strong opinions but I truly believe that the customer is always right.  I'll take MacOS before Linux, and Linux before Windows; but when Windows is the answer, well, I can do that too.  I prefer open source software and have often sold it to the open minded, though there is also a place for commercial solutions.  I recognize the value of good design, and I also recognize that my strength lies in implementing the creation of a talented designer.  In fact, I would describe myself as a jack of all trades; experienced enough in any given domain to have an opinion, but wise enough to bow to the experts.</p>

    <p>And if you're looking for conversation starters between technical interviews... I grew up in San Diego, but I've lived in New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and now San Francisco.  I've done a fair bit of traveling through Europe and Asia; Central and South America are next on the agenda.  I'm a solid snowboarder, decent surfer, recreational scuba diver, and occasional glass blower.  I've won blue ribbons at the county fair.  I make a decent jambalaya and a mean sesame peanut noodles.</p>
