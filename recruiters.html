<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I don't know you, but if you're reading this you're probably a technology recruiter. That's great. I've talked to lots of recruiters, hell, I used to date one!</p>
<p>That said, there are a few things that many recruiters overlook when contacting me, and I'd like to take this space to enlighten you.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Don't call, <span style="font-style: italic;">email</span>. I, like you, have a job. My job is often paid by the hour. Time spent chatting with you on the phone, while pleasant, is not billable. Please don't impose on my livelihood by insisting on a phone call when you could very easily summarize your available postings in an email.</li>

  <li>Know your audience. I'm sure you never do this, but I've definitely had calls from recruiters looking for a skill set that I don't have. My <a href="http://www.codetastic.com/resume-chrono.html" title="resume">resume</a> is always up to date (since it's my livelihood), please compare it to your listings and contact me with jobs that seem to be a good match.</li>

  <li>Be specific. Emails full of vague assurances of open positions are usually an indication that you either a) haven't researched me or, b) have nothing worth advertising. I try to respond to these (though sometimes I wonder why), but when I do, all I want is a specific listing.</li>

  <li>I like where I live. I'm perfectly happy to telecommute, but please don't waste either of our times with jobs that require me to move to Mississippi (nothing against Mississippi, it's just fun to type).</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for your time. Please don't hesitate to email if you have a position that I might be interested in!</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br /></p>
