<div class="summary">
    As a deeply technical engineering leader, I drive projects ranging from
cloud deployments to web applications, focusing on healthcare and
neurotech.  I am a passionate generalist with skills in a variety of
disciplines including management, education, and public speaking.  I architected
and built a cloud storage and API system that has been in production for nearly
ten years, supporting thousands of EEG headsets and hundreds of thousands of
recordings . I have shepherded a team building a cloud-based analysis pipeline
from ideation through internal deployment and public launch, working closely
with stakeholders in product and marketing.  I have done all of this and more,
with an endearing smile and a positive attitude.
