<h4> A Little Anatomy </h4> 

From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain" >
Wikipedia::Back_Pain </a>:
<p>Muscle strains (pulled muscles) are commonly identified as the cause of back 
pain but in fact muscle imbalances are by far the most common cause of low 
back pain, and pain from such an injury will often hang around for as long 
as the muscle imbalances persist. The muscle imbalances cause a mechanical 
problem with the skeleton which leads to pressure building up at certain 
points along the spine.</p>
