      <h3> Projects </h3>
	<p> <em class="project"><a
href="http://www.wisegeek.com/strongwiki/">Strongwiki</a></em> solves a
problem that I've been contemplating for years.  How do I carry around a
little bit of encrypted information that I can decrypt and view on any
computer, anywhere?  I hit on the answer last year and built Strongwiki -- a
javascript wiki with built-in strong encryption.  I borrowed the javascript
file storage code and build tools from <a
href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>, the encryption code from <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/">JavaScrypt</a>, and the the markup
from <a href="http://www.attacklab.net">Showdown</a>.  A little lightbox magic
and some prototype and my problem was solved. The project is open source and
the home page is <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/strongwiki">StrongWiki</a>
I should also note that hosting has been generously donated by <a
href="http://www.wisegeek.com">wiseGEEK</a>. </p> 

	<p> <em class="project">Trabian</em> is a Rails shop that specializes
in content management systems for Credit Unions.  They contracted me to create
a polling plugin for <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com">Mephisto</a> (which
their CMS is based on).  I did it, they were happy, and RealSoonNow we'll make
it available to the public!</p> 

	<p> <em class="project"> Adhoc Mobile </em>needed an administrative
area to create and publish advertisements on their network of mobile
applications.  They had built the back end as web services using J2EE and
SOAP, and my project was to use those services to add advertisements into the
system.  I chose Rails and Prototype/Scriptaculous to implement everything as
an opportunity to delve into ActiveResource (which was beta at the time).

<p> <em class="project"> Mabo Studios </em> specializes in outsourcing architectural rendering
to China.  They needed a site where their customers and vendors could see the
progress of their projects.  The site uses Ruby on Rails and is my first
journey into the joy that is programming Rails.  This is also the first project
on which I flew entirely solo.

<p> <em class="project"> Convisia Design Collaborator </em> is a Java thick client app for
shared markup of blueprints, medical imaging, or anything else.  It was built
using JBoss on the backend and communicating via JMS to the Swing client.  Most
of my work was on the front end, but I did a bit of hacking on the server side
as well.  Learned a lot of Swing tricks and really got my head around the whole
model-view-controller pattern on this project.  
</p>

<p> <em class="project"> Sora City </em> is a cell phone / flash game written in Java and 
based on a platform called the BEAST.  The BEAST was a Java project that I had 
the pleasure of designing, managing, and coding (at various points).  The team
was amazing and the concept was fascinating.  It consisted of a customizable 
event engine that allowed characters to participate in events while the 
users were offline.  The results of the events were presented to the users 
in a blog format whenever the user checked in on his phone or via a flash 
interface.  It was a fascinating idea that never quite made it due to a variety
of business difficulties (dealing with cellphone carriers is unpleasant).

<h3> Presentations </h3>

<p> <em class="project"> <a href="activeresource/">Active Resource</a></em>  I
never actually gave this presentation that I put together for sd.rb.  But I
have the slides, so I figure I ought to get them out there.  Incidentally this
talk covers ActiveResource as it existed in edge rails in March 2007, so the
information is pretty dated. </p>

<p> <em class="project"> <a href="intermediatePhotos/">Intermediate Photography
: or what the other buttons do </a></em> was given at <a
href="www.barcampsd.org">Bar Camp San Diego</a> in June 2007.  As it turns out,
the crowd was mostly advanced photographers, but we had a good time anyway.
</p>

<p> <em class="project"> <a href="yoga/">Coder Yoga</a></em> was given at <a
href="http://www.barcampla.org">BarCampLA-2</a>.  The slides are very
bare-bones, but they list quite a few stretches that can be done at (or near)
your desk.  Mostly I wanted to post these slides because <a
href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/11/barcamp-la-starts-to.html"> Cory
Doctorow mentioned this talk on Boing Boing</a>.</p>

<h3> Fun Stuff </h3>
<p> <em class="project"><a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/developer/devlist.html?email=matt%40codetastic.com">Google Sans About</a></em>  A friend was complaining about about.com search results polluting his searches.  So I built a little firefox searchbar plugin that doesn't return anything from about.com.  Easy enough, and it made his life a little better!</p>
