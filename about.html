      <p> When I was a mere lad, my dear father imparted an important lesson
to me.  He said, "in this country, the only way to really succeed is to be
your own boss." Years later, I've come to realize that mine is not the path of
the entrepreneur. I don't have any great ideas for my own company, but I do
have the skills to help others realize their dreams. Codetastic is my company,
but it only exists to help yours succeed.
</p>

<p>
    I have two decades of experience with technology companies ranging from
    Fortune500 chip manufacturers to medical device startups vying for FDA
    approval to newly minted mobile gaming startups building a team from
    scratch. I have built apps based entirely on serverless and wired 2U boxes
    into racks. I have redesigned interfaces, architected data warehouses and
    ETL pipelines, and consulted on ML model design. All of this is to say, I am
    fully qualified to advise you on a range of technology issues. Considering
    a move to the cloud and want to take advantage of cloud native architecture?
    Want help handling GDPR, CCPA, or even ADA compliance? Want to set up a two
    sided marketplace? Debating whether to build an engineering team or contract
    it out, on-shore, near-shore, or off-shore? I've faced all of these issues
    and more!
</p>

      <p> In short, whether you're looking for an experienced person to
implement a project, or you're looking for answers for some tough technology
questions, I can help.  Feel free to <a
href="mailto:matt@codetastic.com">send</a> a short description of your needs
and we can schedule a consultation.</p>
