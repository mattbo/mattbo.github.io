      <p> When I was a mere lad, my dear father imparted an important lesson
to me.  He said, "in this country, the only way to really succeed is to be
your own boss."  Years later, I've come to realize that I don't have any great
ideas for my own company, but I do have the skills to help other entrepreneurs
realize their dreams.  Codetastic is my company, but it only exists to help
yours succeed.  </p>

      <p> As a coder/hacker/software engineer, my skills include a variety of
languages and platforms.  However, the value that I can bring to your company
far exceeds mere programming.  Having worked with a variety of start-up
companies and small teams, I am fully qualified to advise you on a range of
technology issues.  Want to leverage free software but not sure about where to
start?  Concerned about scalability when your application goes public?
Uncertain about what hardware you need to buy, or if you should contract with
a hosting company instead?  Need advice on who to hire and when to start
looking for them?  I've faced all of these issues and more!</p>

      <p> In short, whether you're looking for an experienced person to
implement a project, or you're looking for answers for some tough technology
questions, I can help.  Feel free to <a
href="mailto:matt@codetastic.com">send</a> a short description of your needs
and we can schedule a consultation.
